# TRP 1 – MCP Setup Challenge

This repository contains my submission for the **TRP 1: MCP Setup Challenge**, demonstrating integration of the Tenx Model Context Protocol (MCP) server with VS Code and implementation of AI agent behavior rules inspired by **Boris Cherny’s workflow**.

## 📁 Repository Structure

```
├── .github/
│   └── copilot-instructions.md    # AI agent rules file (MCP-compliant + Boris Cherny principles)
├── research/

└── report.md                      # Comprehensive reflection covering all rubric dimensions
```

## 🎯 Key Components

### 1. **MCP Server Integration**
- Successfully configured **VS Code** with the **Tenx MCP server**.
- All agent interactions were logged via MCP during development, ensuring auditability and compliance.

### 2. **AI Agent Rules (`copilot-instructions.md`)**
- Located in the standard `.github/` directory as required.
- Combines:
  - **Mandatory MCP trigger workflow** (for logging every interaction)
  - **Boris Cherny–inspired behavioral guidelines**, including:
    - **Plan-first execution**
    - **Subagent role adoption** (e.g., Data Engineer, Research Editor)
    - **Self-verification protocols**
    - **Living-document philosophy**

### 3. **Research & Documentation**
- **`report.md`**: Detailed reflection addressing all four required sections:
  - What I Did
  - What Worked
  - What Didn’t Work
  - Insights Gained
- **`research/Boris Cherny's workflow.docx`**: Archival artifact demonstrating deep engagement with primary source material.

## 🧠 Insights

> “Precise, imperative rules transform AI from a passive tool into an intentional collaborator. By embedding planning, verification, and role specialization—directly from Boris Cherny’s practice—I significantly improved output reliability and alignment with academic and engineering standards.”
